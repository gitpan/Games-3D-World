===========

This package provides a class that contains one entire 3D game world.

For some background information, as well reasoning why this was developed and
why in this way, browse to:

	http://bloodgate.com/perl/sdl/game.html

Installation
============

* untar/ungzip the package (replace 0.03 with the version you got)

	tar -xzf Games::3D-World-0.03.tar.gz

* Check the signature. Download my key from http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc or
  from my CPAN directory. Then do in the build directory (where you unwrapped
  stuff):

	cpansign -v

* if the signature verifies OK, proceed. Otherwise NOTIFY ME IMMIDIATELY. Do
  NOT INSTALL THE PACKAGE! Your system might get compromised!

* Build the make file:

	perl Makefile.PL

* Make the project

	make

* Run the tests:

	make test

* If some tests fail, please notify me.

* If all tests pass, install as root:

	su
	[enter password]
	make install
	exit

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
